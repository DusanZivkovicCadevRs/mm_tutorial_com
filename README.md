# An API Written with Node.js Using Restify & MongoDB

## Part 1: Getting Started with MongoDB, Node.js and Restify

In the `part-1` directory, I cover how to set up a simple API with full CRUD operations using the ever-popular Restify framework backed by a MongoDB database. For sake of simplicity, we’ll create a basic “to-do” style API.

The official blog post for this is located [here](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/getting-started-with-mongodb-nodejs-and-restify).

## Part 2: Introducing Mongoose to Your Node.js and Restify API

In the `part-2` directory, we'll integrate Mongoose, a massively popular ODM for MongoDB. Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, right out of the box. In addition to Mongoose, we’ll also convert the original codebase to use ES6 standards with Babel, the go to compiler for writing next generation JavaScript.
